## Problem
I use the YouTube subscription page to see the videos I need to watch.

There is YouTube hide functionality which I'm using to make my subscriptions dashboard clean. Unfortunately, each time I have to open the context menu and click the hide button to do that. I wanted to make my life easier in that subject.

An extension is primitive and was created in under 20 minutes using AI.

## Potential ideas
- [ ] Customize button label, icon and color
- [ ] Auto hide watched videos
- [ ] After hiding video, removing black box immediately
